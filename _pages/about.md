Hi, I am Milos Davidovic - a software developer from Serbia, and this is my tech blog. I enjoy writing web applications, mostly using Microsoft related technologies, and sharing what I learn along the way. Here I write about Tech stuff I am interested in, with hope that someone will find some of the information useful to.
  
If I am not by my computer, you can probably find me in the gym.
